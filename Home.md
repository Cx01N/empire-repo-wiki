# Empire
# test2
Empire 3.0 is a post-exploitation framework that includes a pure-PowerShell 2.0 Windows agent, and compatibility with Python 3.x Linux/OS X agents. It is the merger of the previous PowerShell Empire and Python EmPyre projects. The framework offers cryptologically-secure communications and flexible architecture.

On the PowerShell side, Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable post-exploitation modules ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework. PowerShell Empire premiered at [BSidesLV in 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq9t59w0mUI) and Python EmPyre premiered at HackMiami 2016. BC-Security presented updates to further evade Microsoft Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) and JA3/S signatures at [DEF CON 27](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/DEFCON27).

Empire relies heavily on the work from several other projects for its underlying functionality. We have tried to call out a few of those people we've interacted with [heavily here](http://www.powershellempire.com/?page_id=2) and have included author/reference link information in the source of each Empire module as appropriate. If we have failed to properly cite existing or prior work, please let us know at Empire@BC-Security.org.

Empire is developed by [@harmj0y](https://twitter.com/harmj0y), [@sixdub](https://twitter.com/sixdub), [@enigma0x3](https://twitter.com/enigma0x3), [@rvrsh3ll](https://twitter.com/424f424f), [@killswitch_gui](https://twitter.com/killswitch_gui), [@xorrior](https://twitter.com/xorrior), and [@bcsecurity1](https://twitter.com/BCSecurity1). While the main fork for Empire is no longer maintained, this fork is maintained by [BC-Security](https://www.bc-security.org) and will continue to receive periodic updates.
